            <p>
                My name is Daniel R Duarte Cortes, I am 24 years old and have lived exactly half my life in Colombia
                where I was born and the second half here in what was described to me as the land of opportunity. I
                grew up with a single mother who worked as a clothing designer and small business entrepreneur from the
                80â€™s to the early 2000. I was born in May 1994 to a life that looking back now was only preparing me to
                evolve in the way that I have and become the person that I am today.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am dedicated, commited, responsible and love to accept new challenges. I perform well with other as
                well as by my self. I like to give my 110% to everything I do. I like honesty and clearnes when it
                comes to my work. I represent the brand of any company that I work for as if it was my own.
            </p>
